http://localhost:8090/?wsdl

Pinaki,

This is very helpful. It works.

We use http://localhost:18083/AddNumbersImplService.wsdl  to tell the
server the name of the wsdl document. It meets our requirement.

Thanks.

Subject: Re: [gsoap] Error: HTTP GET method not implemented

Try someting like this function, it should help:

int http_get_handler(struct soap *soap)
{ 
 printf("HTTP GET has been called\n");

 FILE *fd;
 size_t r;

 if (!soap_tag_cmp(soap->path, "*.html")) 
 {  
  char buf[20];  
  fprintf(stderr,"HTML file has been asked\n");  
  soap_response(soap, SOAP_HTML);  
  sprintf(buf, "<html>HTTP GET OK</html>");  

  soap_send(soap, buf);  
  soap_end_send(soap);  

  return SOAP_OK; 
 }  
 if (!soap_tag_cmp(soap->path, "*.xml")|| !soap_tag_cmp(soap->path,
"*.xsd")|| !soap_tag_cmp(soap->path, "*.wsdl"))  
 {     
   printf("xml / xsd / wsdl file has been asked\n"); 
  fd =
fopen("/garl/garl-alpha1/home/pinaki/MSRProject/usingMSSQL-4/dimeservice
.wsdl", "rb");    
  if (!fd)
   return 404; // return HTTP not found error  

  soap->http_content="text/xml";    
  soap_response(soap,SOAP_FILE); 

  for (;;)
  {
   r = fread(soap->tmpbuf, 1, sizeof(soap->tmpbuf), fd);

   if (!r)
    break;

   if (soap_send_raw(soap, soap->tmpbuf, r))
    break; 
  }

  fclose(fd);
  soap_end_send(soap);
  return SOAP_OK;   
 }  

 if (soap->path[1] == '\0' || soap-> path[1] == '?')  
  printf("NULL value\n"); 
 return 0; 

}

Here the wsdl file being sent and its location mainly needs to be
changed. You need some other plugins elsewhere

	Hi,

	When I use JAX-WS 2.0 client to call a web service developed in
gSOAP, I got the following error:

	Error 14 fault: SOAP-ENV:Client [no subcode]

	"HTTP GET method not implemented"

	Detail: [no detail]

	I think this is because the client tries to use the HTTP GET
method to retrieve the WSDL document from the server.

	How to solve it, or is there a work-around solution about it?

	Thanks for your help very much.
